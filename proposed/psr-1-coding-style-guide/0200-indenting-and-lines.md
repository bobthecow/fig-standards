Indenting and Lines
===================

Indenting
---------

Use an indent of either 4 spaces or 1 tab character.

There are advantages to both, but the debate has raged since before the
inception of the World Wide Web, so it's doubtful that a consensus will ever be
reached. Consistency is important, so each project should pick either tabs or
spaces and stick with them.


Line Length
-----------

Consider wrapping lines longer than 80 characters. This is based on known
human cognitive limitations, not the technical limitations of screen windows
or text editors. When necessary, it is encouraged to split a single statement
across subsequent lines, per rules noted elsewhere in this guide.


Other Considerations
--------------------

Code blocks may have as many blank lines as needed to increase readability
and comprehension.

Do not add trailing spaces at the end of lines.
